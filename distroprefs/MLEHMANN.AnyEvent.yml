  If I run the test 03client.t often enough manually I find it hanging
  from time to time. That's why I now use a patched test.

match:
  distribution: "^MLEHMANN/AnyEvent-2.6.tar.gz"
test:
  env:
    DISPLAY: ":121"
    PERL_ANYEVENT_VERBOSE: 2
depends:
  configure_requires:
    Event: 0
  requires:
    Event: 0
patches:
  - "ANDK/patches/AnyEvent-2.6-ANDK-01.patch.gz"
