  NOT FOR SERIOUS USE!!!

  Beware, this is just for a binary search to find the patchlevel when
  it stopped to compile.

match:
  distribution: "^TELS/devel/Devel-Size-0.70"

# only enable this when you have sending of reports disabled, it leads
# to bogus test reports

#test:
#  args:
#    - "TEST_FILES=t/pod*.t"
