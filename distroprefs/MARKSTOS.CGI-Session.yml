  At the time of this writing 4.20 fails as miserably as 4.20_1. I
  only wrote this file to have a reminder.

  ALERT! Broken! When the target of a goto does not succeed, there is
  the chance to loop endlessly.

  ALERT: without the dependencies 2 in 300 testruns succeed due to
  SKIPped tests.

match:
  distribution: "^MARKSTOS/CGI-Session-4.20"
# goto: "MARKSTOS/CGI-Session-4.20_1.tar.gz"
depends:
  requires:
    DB_File: 0
    FreezeThaw: 0
    DBD::mysql: 0
    DataSource: 0
