  Added XML::LibXML to satisfy XML::Validator::Schema and maybe others
  later. XML::SAX would accept to be installed without parser, do not
  know why.

  Introduced eexpect after seeing that the question is not asked when
  we are called very early, like on 20081105T0337

match:
  distribution: "^GRANTM/XML-SAX-\d"
pl: 
  eexpect:
    mode: anyorder
    timeout: 10
    reuse: 0
    talk:
      - "Do you want XML::SAX to alter ParserDetails.ini"
      - "y\n"
depends:
  configure_requires:
    XML::LibXML: 0
