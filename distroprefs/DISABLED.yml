  Various reasons

  things that hang

  things that have too interactive tests, that cannot be easily
  automated

  things that need ressources we don't have

  or W:M:Pluggable kills the cpan shell with kill(); I don't understand how

  or Shell-GetEnv throws me into a shell and sits there doing nothing

  etc.
