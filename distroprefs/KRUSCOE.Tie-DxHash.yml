  I suspect some recent version of T:P:C (short before
  2007-11-15T23:07) broke it and some skip silenced the test in many
  cases. And I expect that with this build_requires below it fail
  consistently.

match:
  distribution: "KRUSCOE/Tie-DxHash-\d"
depends:
  build_requires:
    Test::Perl::Critic: 0
