  In version 1.47 we really need both variables but from looking at
  the code only the latter is used. (?)

  Keep in mind: they are needed whenever we run it!

match:
  distribution: "JRENNIE/WordNet-QueryData-\d"
  perlconfig:
    archname: "linux"
pl:
  env:
    WNHOME: "/usr/share/wordnet"
    WNSEARCHDIR: "/usr/share/wordnet"
