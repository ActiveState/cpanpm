  Because the Makefile.PL depends on having DBI installed we want to
  let them build DBI and then rerun perl Makefile.PL and then make.

  It is a crazy example that I do not really like. I prefer resolving
  such a thing with configure_requires (which does not exist yet) and
  see it as a Todo item that such hacks are not needed in the future.

  1.13 does not work with 3.3.14. When I upgraded to 3.3.14 I had to
  add the USE_LOCAL_SQLITE to get the tests pass.

match:
  distribution: "^MSERGEANT/DBD-SQLite-1\.13\.tar\.gz"
make:
  commandline: "$PERL Makefile.PL USE_LOCAL_SQLITE=1; make"
