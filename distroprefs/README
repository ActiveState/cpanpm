The files in this directory are YAML files that specify how CPAN.pm shall treat
distributions that deviate from the normal model of

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make install

Some modules try to get some data from the user interactively thus
disturbing the installation of large bundles like Phalanx100 or
modules like Plagger.

CPAN.pm can use these YAML files to either pass additional arguments
to one of the four commands, set environment variables or instantiate
an Expect object that reads from the console, waits for some regular
expression and enters some answer.

Many of the files that come with the CPAN.pm distribution contain more
fields than necessary so they can easier be used as blueprints. In
practice all empty fields can be removed from the YAML files. To find
a blueprint pick one of the larger files.

The YAML files themselves must have the .yml extension, all other
files are ignored. The containing directory can be specified in
CPAN.pm in the prefs_dir config variable. Try 'o conf init /prefs/' in
the CPAN shell.

The names of the files can be picked freely, CPAN.pm always reads all
files and takes the key "qr" as a regex that will be matched against
the canonical distribution name, e.g. "AUTHOR/Foo-Bar-3.14.tar.gz".

Please report your improvements on the files. Any additions and
corrections are welcome. Thank you!

Enjoy,
