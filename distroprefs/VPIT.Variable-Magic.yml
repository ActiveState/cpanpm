  Warning: this distroprefs file was only needed for a binary search
  today (2007-10-21) between 28381 and current blead. At some point
  the glibc noise that accompaniied 28381 disappeared again and we had
  to determine the patch that fixed the glibc noise. 28969 did it.

  But between 28969 and 32152...

match:
  distribution: "VPIT/Variable-Magic-0.04.tar.gz"
test:
  args:
    - "TEST_FILES=t/10-simple.t"
